# Wordle Client
> I completed this project for the course CS4700, Network Fundamentals, which I am currently taking at Northeastern University (Fall 2024).
> The assignment was to write a program in a language of our choice (I used Python) that would use a socket to send word guesses to a Wordle game server and receive feedback to narrow down the options.
> The professor requested that we don't publicly publish our code, but I'm happy to temporarily make it public on request.
